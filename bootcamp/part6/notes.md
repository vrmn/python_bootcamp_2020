what happens when you type python pythonscript.py in the terminal.

well everything in indentation level zero will be executed

just like there is built in function in python this is also a built in variable called name
<!-- ___name__  -->

so when you run python pythonscript.py and it has name what happens is that python
assigns variable __name__ = "__main__"

so

def myfunc():

def myfunc2():



if __name__ == "__main__":

    # RUN THE SCRIPT
    myfunc()
    myfunction2()

    logic


usually what is done is that functions get defined on pythonscript
