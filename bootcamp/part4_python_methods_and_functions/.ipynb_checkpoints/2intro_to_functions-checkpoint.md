creating clean repeatable code is a key part of becoming an effective programmer

functions allow us to create a blocks of code that can be easily executed many times.
Without the need to constantly rewrite the entire block of code

Its important to get practice combining everything you've learned so far (control, loops, logic)
with functions to become an effective programmer.
