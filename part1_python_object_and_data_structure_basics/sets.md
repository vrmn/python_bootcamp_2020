Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, which means you can have any double of anything.

my_set = set()

my_set.add()  to add stuff to set.

my_set.add(1)

my_set
output: {1}

my_set.add(2)

my_set
output: {1,2}  if you try to add to again you'll still get the same result. Only accepts new unique values
