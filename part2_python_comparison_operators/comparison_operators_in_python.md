equality 2 == 2   True
         1 == 2   False remember you use one equal sign when assigning variable

         This can be any object
         'hello' == 'bye'   False

         2.0 == 2 True

inequality  3 != 3 False
            2 != 1 True   then there is <= => > <  pretty much you know what to do with these

Chaining Comparison Operators

We can use logical operators to combine comparisons  such as ( and, or, not )

1 < 2 < 3   True
1 < 2  and 2 < 3    True   is whats on the left and right true

1 == 1 or 2 == 2    True    only one of the two need to be true

1 == 1 True     All not is asking for is the opposite boolean of whatever was returned.
not 1 == 1 False  


400 > 5000 False
not 400 > 5000 True
