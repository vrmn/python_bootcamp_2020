numbers with decimal                       float     2.3   4.6
ordered sequence of characters             str        "sammy"
ordered sequence of objects                list     [10, "hello", 200.3]
undordered key value pairs                 dict     {"mykey":"value","name":"frankie"}
ordered immutable sequence of objects      tup      (10, "hello", 200.3)

logical value                              bool     True or False

python numbers

2 + 1

3 - 2

2 * 2

3 / 2

mod operator find out the remainder

7 / 4 = 1.75

7 % 4 = 3   Three because its the remainder

50 % 5 = 0   you'll get zero if the number is divisible by that number

23 % 2 = 1   good way to check if a number is even or not

20 % 2 = 0

2 ** 3 = 8  two to the power of 3

(2 + 10) * (10 + 3)  = 156

2 + 10 * 10 + 3 = 105


NOTE YOU CAN USE JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS SHIFT + TAB  WHICH WILL OPEN UP INFORMATION FOR FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEFINED.
